This repository complements an academic report title "Statistical mechanics for the Ginzburg-Landau equation" that I submitted as part of the MSc in Mathematical Modelling and Scientific Computing at the University of Oxford. The report reproduces and explains the results of [1], which proposes a methodology based on statistical mechanics to describe far-from-equilibrium systems, using the one-dimensional complex Ginzburg-Landau equation as a model example.
